> The most recent workshop can be found [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/community-relations/developer-evangelism/projects/#workshops) and includes more learning practice for GitLab CI/CD, based on this first version. 

The presentation by [Michael Friedrich](https://gitlab.com/dnsmichi): [Make your life as developer easier with CI/CD and the Web IDE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1scYkmV4Xdfj-8iwwpEiLCe0vBfpAdrL5pyA2w1Fgnf0/edit?usp=sharing) includes exercises for self-practice. Start learning GitLab CI/CD and tweet [@dnsmichi](https://twitter.com/dnsmichi) with your experiences and screenshots!

The CI config solution is provided in the [.gitlab-ci.solution.yml](.gitlab-ci.solution.yml) file in case you need assistance from the exercises.
